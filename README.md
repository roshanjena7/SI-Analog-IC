# System Overview
MEMS Microphone (SPH8878LR5H-1): Captures sound and outputs an analog voltage signal
Op-Amp (OPA344): Amplifies & filters
ADC + USB Output: Digitizes and sends to PC
🎧 This design enables real-time USB-MIDI output via analog signal conditioning.

# 🎛️ Thevenin Equivalent Model of the Microphone
To understand the microphone as a signal source, it can be modeled with its Thevenin equivalent:

This model helps in:

Analyzing signal strength and loading
Impedance matching for the amplifier input
Ensuring minimal signal loss at the interface
