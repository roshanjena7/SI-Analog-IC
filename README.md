## 2. Introduction to linear circuits and passive devices

Understanding passive devices (RLC) using basic EM principles.
Principle of linearity and superposition
Network analysis: KCL, KVL, node theorems, Thevenin, Norton
Emphasis on interfacing circuits and power transfer principle.
## 3. Basics of MOS device physics

Introduction to pn junctions.
MOS as capacitor.
Threshold voltage.
IV characteristics.
Parasitic capacitance.
##4. Basics of analog building blocks

Current mirror design: simple, cascode and wide-swing mirrors
